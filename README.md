# Bold Slate Clone

This is a clone of [boldslate.com](https://boldslate.com) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `src/app/page.tsx`: The main homepage component.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (Hero, Testimonials, etc.).
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Global layout including Navbar and Footer.

## Deployment on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new).

1. Push this code to a GitHub repository.
2. Import the repository in Vercel.
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and deploy.

No special configuration is needed.
